                <h2>
                    About Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Born and raised in the country, I relocated to Perth in 2016 to create better opportunities for my
                    children.
                    My career journey has taken me through a range of industries including hospitality, disability
                    services, and
                    more recently, the mining sector. I’ve always had a passion for technology, sparked by an early
                    interest in
                    programming during high school. That passion was reignited while exploring options for women in
                    tech,
                    leading me to the She Codes Plus program. I'm now expanding my skills in coding, including HTML,
                    CSS,
                    and Python, and excited about the future opportunities in the tech industry.

                    What I do for fun.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I love traveling—especially to visit my daughter in Victoria whenever I get the
                    chance.
                    I'm currently exploring my creative side by learning to paint using a variety of mediums, which has
                    been
                    both fun and rewarding. I enjoy camping anywhere I can pitch a tent and soak in nature, and I’m
                    always up
                    for quality time with family and friends. Walking and relaxing with my two beloved fur babies,
                    Hercules and Goliath,
                    is a daily highlight. Whether it’s adventure or quiet moments, I embrace activities that bring joy,
                    connection, and
                    creativity into my life.

                    Career so Far
                </h2>
                <p>
                    With a background in psychology, I’ve built a career centered on people-focused roles.
                    I worked extensively in NDIS support coordination and mental health, collaborating with multiple
                    stakeholders to deliver tailored services. A key part of my role involved implementing housing
                    programs that empowered participants to live independently in their own homes. I’ve also worked
                    across finance and accounting, backed by an Advanced Diploma, and held roles in hospitality and
                    mining utilities and administration. Now, as I complete the She Codes Plus program, I’m combining
                    my technical skills with my human-centered experience to transition into the tech industry.
