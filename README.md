## Project Requirements

### Content
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make? 
- [x] At least one profile picture (photo of painting)
- [x] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [x] Functional Contact Form
- [x] "Projects" section
- [x] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.
I have included a photo of hercules one of our puppies (I dont actually have many photos of myself), but will attach a profile photo at a later stage. I have also attached to my "what I do for Fun" section a photo of a painting.
On the home page I have an About Me section with general info about myself as well as a what I do for fun and Career so Far and Skills. There is responsive navigation at the top that when hovered over changes colour and is underlined This was fun to create. The navigation leads to a projects page that is still under construction and to a contact form that is functioning. There is Icons for LinkedIn and GitHub with links to both pages (my linked in needs updating).

### Technical
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What strategies or design decisions did you work from? 
- [x] At least 2 web pages.
- [x] Version controlled with Git
- [x] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [x] Implements responsive design principles.
- [x] Uses semantic HTML.
I have 3 pages, Home, Projects and Header. Header and footer are the same on all pages. 
Nav buttons on all pages. Version controlled with Git and deployed on GitHub pages. Initial colors
needed to be changed as they did not meet accessability requirement. Elements can be accessed with 
tab button on desktob. Would have liked the header stays visable when scrolling. Used CSS from course as a base for 
building and exploring the project allowing me to understand what all the components where for and how they worked
by removing them or changing them. 

### Bonus (optional)
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any. 
- [X] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)
​Added active hover and focus states for the nav elements in the header and linked in and git hub icon, when selected with
the mouse or on touch screen the elements change color from black to pink and a line appears from left
to right underneath the element, the line is hidden beneath the element when not in use.

### Screenshots
> Please include the following:
> - The different pages and features of your website on mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes (multiple screenshots per page and screen size).
Flex box elements are used so boxes appear in rows on desktop and columns on phone and tablet. Sticky heading ensures access to the menu when scrolling on all platforms. Nav (menu) elements stack when on mobile or tablet and are in a row on desktop. 

> - The different features of your site, e.g. if you have hover states, take a screenshot that shows that.
Hover states on nav menu items that change color and underline when hovering or selecting. Sticky header to allow header to remain visable when scrolling on all platforms.
